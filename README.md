Language learning projects

## Purpose

This is an Obsidian Vault I've set up for my wife to practice her Esperanto skills through translation projects. 

Ideally, I'll also teach her how to use Obsidian, MarkDown, and potentially Git in the process. 

For now, I've set up the workspace for her to easily make the translations without worrying about the underlying technology - despite her being more than capable with learning the pipeline - so she can focus on reinforcing the amazing amount of Esperanto she's learned through dedication and percistance. 

If you're an Esperanto speaker, please feel free to open an issue if you disagree with one of her translations as I'll be dealing with the front-facing side of things for now. 

We're not currently looking for contributors as this is a self-learning project, though that may change in the future. 

Feel free to fork this repo if you feel it could help you learn Esperanto as well. We would be much obliged if you could star the repo if you did.

I'll start an FAQ if I get any questions. 

Sincerely,
KGB
